## Code Style Guidelines

### Python
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for formatting
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Docstrings for all public functions

### JavaScript/React
- Use ESLint recommended rules
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### General
- Write self-documenting code
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Add comments for complex logic only
- Prefer clarity over cleverness

## Testing Guidelines

### Frontend Tests
- Use React Testing Library
- Test user interactions, not implementation
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Mock external dependencies

### Backend Tests
- Use pytest
- Test edge cases
- Mock external services
- Test error handling

### Example Test
```python
def test_python_reviewer_detects_eval():
    code = "result = eval(user_input)"
    diagnostics = run_python_review(code)
    
    assert len(diagnostics) > 0
    assert any(d['ruleId'] == 'security/no-eval' for d in diagnostics)
    assert any(d['severity'] == 'error' for d in diagnostics)
```

## Security Guidelines

1. **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, tokens)
2. **Sanitize user input** in all reviewers
3. **Use subprocess timeouts** to prevent DoS
4. **Validate file paths** to prevent directory traversal
5. **Keep dependencies updated**
6. **Run security scans** before submitting PR

## Adding a New Language Reviewer

1. Create `backend/reviewers/{language}_reviewer.py`
2. Implement `run_{language}_review(code: str) -> List[Dict]`
3. Add language to the router in `backend/app.py`
4. Update language selector in `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.jsx`
5. Add tests in `backend/tests/test_{language}_reviewer.py`
6. Update README.md

## Documentation

- Update README for user-facing changes
- Add inline comments for complex code
- Update API documentation for endpoint changes
- Include examples where helpful

## Questions?

- Open an issue with the `question` label
